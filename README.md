# fizzbuzz_js
By [Scott Macpherson](https://github.com/scottmacphersonmusic)

### Description
fizzbuzz_js is a small project to implement a solution for the classic 'fizzbuzz' problem in JavaScript.

### Usage
First create a new instance of `FizzBuzz`:

`fb = new FizzBuzz();`

There is only one method, `compute(first, last)`, which takes a starting number and an ending number as arguments, computes fizzbuzz for each number in between (incusive) and returns a string of the results separated by line:

`console.log(fb.compute(1, 1000));`

would return:

```bash
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
# ...(omitted for brevity)
fizz
997
998
fizz
buzz
```
